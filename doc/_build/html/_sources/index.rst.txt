Installation
==================

*One important issue at the beginning: Please do NOT confuse pycity_base with
the pycity package on pypi! This (other) pycity package is installable via 
pip. However, if you want to install pycity_base, follow this instruction.*

pycity_base requires the following Python packages:
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- networkX
	- pandas
	- pytest
	- xlrd

as well as the EBC Python packages:

- richardsonpy 

which is available under

https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/richardsonpy

- uesgraphs
(with dependencies to shapely and pyproj)

which is available under 

https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/uesgraphs

richardsonpy can be installed via pip.
uesgraphs can be installed via pip on Linux or Mac OS distributions.
In contrast, uesgraphs installation might not be possible via pip on Windows
machines, due to compiler issues with the dependencies to shapely and pyproj.
In this case, follow the instructions of the uesgraphs installation:

https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/uesgraphs/blob/master/README.md

(see Install uesgraphs)



Installation of pycity_base
=============================

The latest version of pycity_base is 0.3.0.

When uesgraph and its dependencies are installed, you should be able to install
pycity_base via pip:

`pip install pycity_base`

or:

`pip install -e '<your_path_to_pycity_setup_folder>'`

or:

`<path_to_your_python_dist\Python.exe> -m pip install -e '<your_path_to_pycity_setup_folder>'`

You can check if installation / adding packages to python has been successful
by adding new .py file and trying to import uesgraphs and pyCity.

`import uesgraphs`

`import pycity_base`

Import should be possible without errors.



Tutorial
==================

pycity_base also has a jupyter notebook tutorial script under pycity/examples/tutorials/... 
To open the jupyter notebook, open a command/terminal window and change your directory to the directory, 
where tutorial_pycity_calc_1.ipynb is stored. Then type 'jupyter notebook' (without '' signs) and press Enter.
Jupyter notebook should open within your browser (such as Firefox). Click on one notebook to start.
If your Pyhton path does not point at your Python installation, you have to
open jupyter notebook directly, e.g. by looking for the jupyter.exe in your distribution.
