        This input should also be equivalent to "pwd" and "pwe", because only

    average_profile : array-like
        Minute-wise sampled average tap water profiles (in liters per hour).
        "mwwd" and "mwwe" in Lion's thesis.
    occupancy : array-like
        10-Minute-wise sampled occupancy of the considered building/apartment.
    current_day : integer
        Current day of the year (January 1st -> 0, February 1st -> 31, ...)
